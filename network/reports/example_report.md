## Security Recommendations

### High Priority
- [ ] Review all open ports and disable unnecessary services
- [ ] Ensure all services are running latest patched versions
- [ ] Verify firewall rules are properly configured

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Review service banners for information disclosure
- [ ] Implement network segmentation where applicable
- [ ] Schedule regular vulnerability scans

### Low Priority
- [ ] Document all legitimate services and ports
- [ ] Implement IDS/IPS monitoring
- [ ] Review and update security baselines

## Appendix

### Scanning Methodology
This scan was performed using nmap with the following approach:
1. Host discovery to identify active systems
2. Port scanning to enumerate open services
3. Service version detection for vulnerability assessment
4. OS fingerprinting where applicable
